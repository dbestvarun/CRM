# Nutricana CRM

This is a modern, premium-quality Customer Relationship Management (CRM) web application built as part of my internship learning journey. The project is a prototype of what I designed for Nutricana Livestock Pvt. Ltd. and showcases a clean, monochrome UI with a focus on modularity, scalability, and real-world business features.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Frontend-only:** This CRM currently has no backend; all data is stored in-memory and resets on refresh. (Backend integration is planned for the future.)
- **Tech Stack:**
  - React (with TypeScript)
  - Material UI (MUI) for a premium, monochrome look
  - Modular component structure
  - Ready for backend/API integration (Flask, Node, etc.)

## ✨ Features
- **Dashboard:** Summary cards for companies, products, and tasks
- **Products:** Manage Nutricana’s cattle feed products (CRUD, responsive grid)
- **Companies:** Manage companies/farmers, track purchases (CRUD)
- **Tasks:** Kanban board for tasks (add/edit/delete, drag-and-drop, responsive)
- **Account:** User profile/settings form
- **Modern UI:** FAANG-level design, mobile-friendly, clean codebase

## 🧑‍💻 Learning Outcomes
- Built real-world CRM features from scratch and also about Refine framework
- Learned best practices in React, TypeScript, and Material UI
- Practiced modularization, state management, and UI/UX design
- Gained experience in preparing a codebase for backend/API integration

## 📝 Notes
- **Persistence:** All data is currently lost on refresh (no backend yet)
- **Next Steps:** Add a Flask (Python) backend for real data persistence and multi-user support
- **Portfolio Ready:** This project is suitable for showcasing in a resume or portfolio
